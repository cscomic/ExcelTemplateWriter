ExcelTemplateWriter
===================


    For many times, we need to output our data to more easy to read. But actually, it hard for us to make excel file
    easy to read by setting formatting in code.

    So, why not split the front end and back end:
      1. user to edit the front end by editing length of column, formatting of value, color and so on
      2. script output data into file with the template edited by user

    This project supply a method of this.
